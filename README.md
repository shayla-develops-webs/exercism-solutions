# Exercism JavaScript Solutions  

This repository contains my solutions to the [Exercism JavaScript track](https://exercism.org/tracks/javascript) exercises.  

I’m using it as a place to:  
- ✍🏽 Practice problem-solving with JavaScript  
- 📚 Document my learning journey and growth  
- 🔍 Explore different approaches to solving coding challenges  

## Structure  
- Each folder corresponds to an Exercism exercise.  
- The main solution file is typically named after the exercise (e.g. `exercise.js`).  
- Tests are provided by Exercism and can be run to verify correctness.  

## About Exercism  
[Exercism](https://exercism.org) is a free platform for practicing programming through exercises, mentorship, and community discussion. The JavaScript track focuses on language fundamentals, problem-solving, and idiomatic JavaScript practices.  

## Notes  
This repo is meant as a personal learning log. If you’re working on the JavaScript track yourself, I recommend trying to solve the problems on your own first before peeking at other solutions—it’s the best way to grow as a developer!
